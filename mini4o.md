# How to Run DeepSeek v3 Locally on Mac Mini

This guide will walk you through setting up and running DeepSeek v3 on a Mac Mini. Follow the steps carefully to ensure a smooth installation.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. **Hardware Requirements**:
   - A Mac Mini with macOS Monterey or later.
   - At least 16GB of RAM (32GB recommended for larger datasets).
   - Sufficient storage space (minimum 50GB, more depending on your data size).

2. **Software Requirements**:
   - Python 3.8 or later.
   - Homebrew (macOS package manager).
   - Git for cloning repositories.
   - Docker (optional but recommended for a containerized setup).

3. **Dependencies**:
   - TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on DeepSeek v3 requirements).
   - Necessary Python libraries (to be installed in the steps below).

## Step 1: Install Homebrew

If Homebrew is not already installed, open Terminal and run:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

Verify the installation:

brew --version

Step 2: Install Python and Git

Install Python 3.10 or later and Git using Homebrew:

brew install python git

Verify the installations:

python3 --version
git --version

Step 3: Clone the DeepSeek v3 Repository

Navigate to your desired installation directory and clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/username/deepseek-v3.git
cd deepseek-v3

Replace https://github.com/username/deepseek-v3.git with the correct repository URL.

Step 4: Set Up a Virtual Environment

Create a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies:

python3 -m venv deepseek-env
source deepseek-env/bin/activate

Step 5: Install Python Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, install the required Python libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

If there’s no requirements.txt, refer to the project documentation for the required libraries.

Step 6: Install Docker (Optional)

For a containerized setup, install Docker:

brew install --cask docker

Launch Docker and ensure it’s running by checking its status:

docker --version

Step 7: Configure DeepSeek v3

Modify any configuration files (e.g., config.yaml) as per your requirements. Refer to the project documentation for specific configuration instructions.

Step 8: Run DeepSeek v3

If running locally:

python main.py

For Docker-based execution:
	1.	Build the Docker container:

docker build -t deepseek-v3 .


	2.	Run the container:

docker run -p 8080:8080 deepseek-v3

Step 9: Access the Application
	•	If running locally, access DeepSeek v3 via the Terminal output URL (e.g., http://localhost:8080).
	•	If using Docker, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080.

Troubleshooting
	•	Python Library Errors: Ensure all dependencies are installed and up to date.
	•	Port Conflicts: If port 8080 is in use, modify the configuration to use a different port.
	•	Performance Issues: Close other applications to free up system resources.

Additional Resources
	•	DeepSeek Documentation
	•	Python Virtual Environments
	•	Docker Documentation

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully run DeepSeek v3 locally on your Mac Mini. If you encounter issues, consult the project’s documentation or community forums.
